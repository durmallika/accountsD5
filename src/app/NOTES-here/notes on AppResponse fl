springboot prj is actually providing the data, which u can show in Angular in json-format, 
any application is comprised of 2-things : 
                        one is presentation layer, where u can present the things,  (ui/ frontend)
                        second is the data, if u have data then only  u can present it , & who gives u the data: it is springboot. (server-side/backend)
